# Hello

I like having a heading that reaches out to you. Hi there.

# I use GitHub a fair bit

Here are some of the projects I have floating around:

## Telefactor

**Homepage**: http://github.com/telefactor/telefactor

**Organization**: http://github.com/telefactor

### What's this?
I created this game where people take turns writing code and testing code as a
way to give my team some room to play with design and testing strategies.

It ends up feeling like a hackathon or game jam but smaller and with focused expectations.

## Textploration

**Site:** http://textploration.herokuapp.com/

**Code:** https://github.com/ssangervasi/textploration

### What's this?
The goal of this project was to make a text-based adventure game as a web app.
Actually, it was to have a tool that would let users build their own games.

I wanted it to have both clickable buttons for the adventure choice, but also a
"console mode" which would support the classic text input adventuring style.

Lastly, all this would be saved to the back end and shareable with other users.

### What happened?
The real adventure was developing the dang thing. Here are some highlights:

1. A [good amount of stuff](https://github.com/ssangervasi/textploration/commit/7599493786e13bb5baaeff33617fd0c3879c7276)
   worked with Angular and TypeScript.
2. And then Angular was breaking so I [replaced it with React](https://github.com/ssangervasi/textploration/commit/fb3cce227353acab087f6f5c28aaeb1c9cd6fade).
3. Here's a commit that introduced Flow instead of TypeScript: ["Breaking everything"](https://github.com/ssangervasi/textploration/commit/d7efdb7064d5e34746d5987c19ccbdfb4a9689af#diff-61c3a17af2ba0f532c026a8e71018355)
4. And here's where I [removed Flow...](https://github.com/ssangervasi/textploration/commit/6805d10136685ac7ac08fac4e3b4176c9afb0f44)
5. Making an [in-memory ORM](https://github.com/ssangervasi/textploration/tree/master/src/txpn/core/ORM) was pretty fun though.

# I gotta get paid
I've also used my ability to tell computers what to do for employment. 

I'm [**SSangervasi** on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssangervasi).

I have an email filter on the word "opportunity" so avoid that if you're going
to recruit me. Instead, use the word "Splunge" and I'll give you special attention.

# Did I claim I was a writer?
Yeah, well I have [Harmless Writing](https://harmlesswriting.com) where I put short fiction.

Here's [one I like](https://harmlesswriting.com/2017/08/19/a-night-out/).

Here's [another](https://harmlesswriting.com/2016/10/17/caught/).

I think that counts.
I've technically got paid for my writing. It was like twenty five bucks but it was
[mostly a fun time](https://harmlesswriting.com/2018/05/20/aficionado/).

## Also, micro-blogging. Do people still use that term? I hope not.
